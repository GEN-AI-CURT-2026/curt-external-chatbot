# CURT Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### When did CURT start?
CURT started in 2012 as a graduation project with Doctor Mostafa Shawky. The team competed in UK that year, putting our flag first as the first Egyptian team to participate in Formula Student in Egypt and the MENA region.

### What is CURT's vision and mission?
Through our project, we want to make the field of engineering more appealing to students so they would choose it as their future career. For engineering students, we give the possibility to get the best possible education through a practical experience of building a real formula student race car.

### Is this a prototype or manufacturing team?
The team only produces one car each year at most, so it's a prototype development team focused on engineering education and competition.

### Will this prototype aim for mass production later?
The knowledge acquired from building such a project can be projected toward electric vehicles mass production. The team has actually been contacted a couple of times by people who wanted to go into the industry.

### What is the percentage of gender equality?
40% of our members are females. The team also includes foreign members.

## Recruitment and Membership

### When does recruitment usually open?
Recruitment opens twice per year:
- **Mid-August:** Main recruitment at start of academic year, immediately after competition
- **Late January:** Second round recruitment
- Additional in-season recruitment occurs at the earliest convenient time

### How can I apply to join CURT?
Follow our Social Media Accounts and stay tuned for any recruitment announcements.

### What does it take to get accepted on CURT?
Be passionate and willing to commit to learning and contributing.

### What engineering majors does the team accept?
For technical roles: Aeronautics and Aerospace, Mechanical Power, Mechanical Design & Production, Electrical Power, Electronics and Communication, Software Engineering, and Chemical Engineering, from both mainstream curriculum and credit hours system at Cairo University's Faculty of Engineering.

For non-technical departments (Business Support): Students from Business and Mass Communication for planning, development, and marketing.

### How much time commitment is expected from team members weekly?
It varies from person to person and between subsystems, depending on goals set for the year. For some, participation is equivalent to a full-time job, while for others it's more like a part-time commitment. The level of engineering work and dedication required is immense, demanding active and consistent involvement.

### What is the motive for team members?
It differs for every individual:
- Some like F1 and want to pursue a career there
- Some want to gain hands-on technical knowledge in specific areas not provided elsewhere
- Many other motives, but they all share one common goal: they want to learn and grow

### Are there mandatory training programs for new members?
Yes, there are mandatory training programs required by technical directors and team leads, including:
- Sessions focused on every subsystem
- For mechanical subteams: CAD and finite element analysis training with projects monitored and graded by team leads
- Tool usage authorization by specialists, with specific training for each tool
- After the learning phase, members review previous designs and are well-prepared to enter the design phase

## Competition and Travel

### How many competitions has CURT joined?
CURT has participated a total of 8 times, starting from 2012 at UK with an ICE Car as the first Formula Student team in MENA Region.

### What are the difficulties traveling to competitions in London?
**Key Travel Challenges:**
- **Financial difficulties:** Completing the car annually to competition standards requires intensive fundraising for parts and fabrication
- **Shipping logistics:** Securing affordable shipping deals for the vehicle to London/Silverstone consumes large portion of budget
- **High costs:** Competition entry fees, visas, and team travel costs for 140+ members strain resources
- **Technical issues:** Past limitations to static events compound preparation pressures
- **Currency fluctuations:** Exacerbate annual funding gaps
- **Sponsor dependencies:** Heavy reliance on partnerships

### Which members travel to competitions and how are they chosen?
**Selection Criteria:**
- Limited to **25 members** who are fully knowledgeable about their subsystem and can serve as strong team representatives
- **Advantage to 2nd/3rd year students:** Guarantees team benefits from their competition experience upon return, ensuring continuity and eligibility for future events
- **Typical profile:** Key departments (Mechanical Power, Design, Electronics, etc.) to handle dynamic events, presentations, and on-site adjustments
- Final choices consider specific competition requirements for technical scrutineering

### How is the car transported to competitions?
- **Method:** Sea freight through specialized shipping sponsors like ABS Logistics (official partner)
- **Process:** Securing shipping deal, crating vehicle securely after completion, coordinating with competition organizers
- **Timing:** Arrival typically 1-2 weeks before events to allow scrutineering and setup
- **Additional items:** Parts and tools may arrive separately via air or sea

### Are members' travel costs funded?
It depends on the year, but most recently living expenses are personal, but flight tickets are secured totally or partially from sponsorship.

## Funding and Support

### Who funds the team?
Various parties fund the team:
- **Cairo University Faculty:** Provides financial aid covering approximately one-sixth (quarter in some sources) of yearly expenses
- **Cash sponsorships:** From various sponsors
- **Component sponsorships:** Parts and materials provided by sponsors

### What is the current fundraising goal for 2025/2026 season?
Focus on:
- Completing remaining parts needed for current car to compete
- Competition-related expenses: entry fees, new tires, driver suits, helmets
- Team continuity: Manufacturing new vehicle and designing new accumulator pack for next year's car
- Battery cells potentially acquired through sponsorships

### What level of support does Cairo University provide?
The Faculty provides financial aid that covers a quarter of yearly expenses if the team plans on consistently developing a Formula Student car to participate yearly in Formula Student.

### Does participation offer academic credit?
Not yet, but it has been discussed before and will be further discussed later this year.

## Operations and Policies
