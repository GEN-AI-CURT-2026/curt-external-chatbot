## Knowledge Transfer System

### Documentation-Based Approach
Knowledge transfer is primarily managed through comprehensive documentation, including:
- Recorded sessions
- PDFs outlining system details
- Documented procedures
- Previous team leaders and members record sessions for each subteam during learning phase

### Key Principles
- Continuous updating and maintenance of documentation is well-established in team culture
- New members must be familiar with entire design process, even if they didn't participate in original design
- Not necessary for original designer to be present to explain decisions
- Thorough documentation ensures knowledge is preserved and accessible
- Documentation ensures knowledge doesn't vanish with graduating members
- Team consistency relies on documentation and right recruitment

### Continuity for Leadership Transitions
When critical leadership (Team Leader, Technical Directors) graduates:
- Documentation is key to ensuring continuity
- Recruiting passionate engineers who are willing to learn, give their all, and be prepared to go through the journey
- Documentation ensures that knowledge doesn't vanish with graduating members

## Training and Development

### Mandatory Training Programs
Required by technical directors and team leads:
- Sessions focused on every subsystem
- For mechanical subteams: CAD and finite element analysis training
- Projects monitored and graded by team leads
- Tool usage must be authorized by specialists within team
- Users must complete specific training for each tool

### Learning Phase
After initial learning phase where members undergo training for their subteam:
- Members are well-prepared to enter design phase
- Members review previous designs created by team
- New members undergo mandatory learning phase before being fully immersed in design process

## Workshop and Manufacturing Access

### University Workshop
- Usage authorized annually by university
- Team can manufacture any required parts on-site

### External Manufacturing Partnerships
If specific machine or capability not available at university workshop:
- Team relies on established partnerships with external manufacturers
- Recent partnerships include: الهيئة الهندسية للتصنيع (Engineering Authority for Manufacturing), Promil, and other manufacturers
- Ensures flexibility and access to advanced manufacturing capabilities
- Enables production of precision components critical for performance
- Team carefully coordinates between internal fabrication and external suppliers to maintain schedules and quality standards
